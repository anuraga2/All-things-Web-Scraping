# All-things-Web-Scraping
This repository contains code that I wrote as a web scraping exercise from FanGraphs and Baseball reference.

Their are two folder in this repo. Each of them has the following content:

* The Fangraph repository contains the code to scrape data from Fangraph data base between the years 1871 to 2019
* The Stat head folder contains the code to scrape data from baseball reference website

In the initital commits the code is not modularized completely. I am planning to make the functions more robust in the future commits
